In 2025, your choice of IDE is no longer just about syntax highlighting and debugging—it’s about how much of your development workflow you want to automate, delegate, and supercharge with AI. From the battle-tested Visual Studio Code to AI-first environments like Cursor, Kiro, and Google Antigravity, developers now have an ecosystem of tools that can understand, design, and even execute code on their behalf.
</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
This post walks through what makes each of these environments unique, where they shine, and how to choose the right mix for your personal workflow or team stack.
</p>

<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Visual Studio Code: The Flexible Baseline</h4>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight, cross-platform editor that has evolved into a de facto standard for modern development. It offers rich support for debugging, intelligent code completion, Git integration, extensions, and theming, all while remaining fast and highly customizable.
</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
For most teams, VS Code is the baseline: a clean editor you can shape into a full IDE for virtually any language using its vast marketplace of extensions and built-in support for remote and web-based editing.
</p>

<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Cursor: AI-First Coding on a VS Code Core</h4>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
Cursor is an AI-assisted IDE built as a fork of VS Code, adding deep AI integration on top of the familiar interface. It uses large language models to power advanced autocomplete, multi-line edits, refactors, and natural-language code generation while retaining VS Code’s layout and extension ecosystem. 
</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
Cursor understands your entire codebase, lets you “chat with your code”, and can rewrite or generate code across multiple files—making it feel like pairing with a senior engineer that knows your repository inside out. 
</p>

<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Kiro: Spec-Driven, Agentic Development</h4>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
Kiro is AWS’s agentic AI coding environment focused on spec-driven development. From a single prompt, it generates structured requirements, technical designs, data flow diagrams, TypeScript interfaces, database schemas, and API endpoints, then orchestrates tasks to implement those specs. 
</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
Built on Code OSS and compatible with VS Code settings and Open VSX extensions, Kiro layers features like Specs, Agent Hooks, Autopilot Mode, and MCP integration on top of a familiar editor, turning AI into a project-level collaborator rather than just a line-by-line assistant. 
</p>

<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Google Antigravity: Agentic IDE with Cloud Models</h4>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
Google Antigravity is an agentic IDE built as a fork of VS Code, tightly integrated with Google’s cloud models through Vertex AI and Google AI Studio. It maintains the VS Code-like experience but adds an AI agent that can write code, run tasks, manage workflows, and operate in different modes—agent-driven, agent-assisted, or review-only. 
</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
Antigravity emphasizes transparent, policy-driven automation, with task views, execution history, and permissions that make it clear what the agent is doing, while offering powerful features like tab autocompletion, natural language code commands, and workspace-aware context. 
</p>

<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">How to Choose the Right IDE for You</h4>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
If you want a stable, extensible editor that you can gradually enhance with AI, VS Code remains the safest starting point, especially for polyglot teams or mixed workloads. 
</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
For AI-native workflows, consider Cursor when you want deep inline coding assistance, Kiro when you need spec-driven, system-level automation on AWS, and Antigravity when you prefer Google’s AI stack and policy-driven agent modes for complex projects.
